# Fruit Freshness Classification (Learning & R&D Project)

## Overview
This project explores fruit freshness classification using deep learning.
The primary objective was to understand how CNN architectures learn visual
patterns rather than optimizing only for accuracy.

## Dataset
Images are categorized into:
- freshapples
- freshbanana
- freshoranges
- rottenapples
- rottenbanana
- rottenoranges

Dataset is organized using ImageFolder-style directories.

## Models
- Normal CNN (baseline)
- TreeCNN (custom experimental architecture)

TreeCNN showed interesting generalization behavior despite lower validation accuracy.

## Key Learnings
- Architecture design influences decision consistency
- Accuracy alone is not sufficient to judge model intelligence
- Data augmentation significantly improves generalization

## Repository Structure
(brief structure)

## Future Work Scope
- Transfer learning
- Web deployment
- Dataset expansion
